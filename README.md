Mushroom Hunter
===============

Call mhunter.py, passing it a link to a json file providing [weather observations from BOM](http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDQ60801/IDQ60801.94294.shtml). It will analyse the data and present some statistics that help to inform whether it's a good time to go foraging for mushrooms.

In the future I want to have it deliver notifications when certain pre-specified conditions are met.
